# Price_Tracker
## Background

My need for a new laptop and curiosity to harness my Python skills inspired this project. The Price_Tracker is supposed to be a content 
aggregator that, in its initial stages, scrapes lapop sales from the newegg website and it is useful for two reaons 1) it
takes the user straight to what they are looking for instead of performing a search first 2) A user can refer to it as frequently as they desire
to see if any sales are available.

## Product Features

## Implemented Feature(s)
-Read and Parse HTML on the website newegg.com on the laptops page 
-Store returned dataset which includes: laptop brand, name with laptop specifications, precvious price(if available), current price, shipping details and user rating out of five

## Features in Production
-SQL DB to store dataset currently stored in a csv file (DB for practice purposes since dataset is not robust)
-Incorporate a web framework to make this a web utility (for practice purposes)
